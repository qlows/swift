Create a playground that contains the following functions:

greet: a function that takes a name as a param and prints greetings using the name
area: a function that takes two integers w and h, returns an area of the rectangle i.e. w*h
area2: a function that takes two integers w and h, returns an area of the rectangle i.e. w*h but does not require label on the function call
calculator: a function that takes two integers (a and b), and a string with an operator that can be +, - or *. The function should contain 3 nested functions 
that perform the action defined by the operator (addition, deduction, or multiplication). The returned value of the calculator function is a result calculated 
by the nested function selected based on the operator param. params a and b are passed to the selected nested function.
